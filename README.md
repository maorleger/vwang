This repo allows me to quickly bootstrap a pairing environment for remote pairing with my buddy Jeff! 

The problem: how can me and Jeff remote pair while still enjoying the comforts of our own vim configuration?

The solution: terraform an EC2 instance, configure it with our public keys, and bootstrap all the setup needed for comfortable remote pairing experience via tmux!

Reading through the bootstrap.sh script it becomes immediately apparent that it depends on a bunch of local dotfiles to be copied over. As I mentioned, this repo is for my own usage!
